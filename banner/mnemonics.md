## Position 3
- Specifies the ***type*** of form/table.
- Generally speaking, a Banner front-end form and back-end data table are related by similar naming, with a different P3 character.
- In limited instances, the third character "V" also represents a view.

P3 | Type                      | P3 | Type
-- | ------------------------- | -- | ------------------------- 
A  | Application form          | Q  | Query form
B  | Base table/batch process  | R  | Rule or repeating table
I  | Inquiry form              | T  | General maintenance
O  | Online COBOL process      | V  | Validation form/table

## Positions 4-7
- The remaining positions identify a unique four-character name for the form, report, process, or table.

## Example
- Table: SCBCRSE
- ***S*** [Student]
- ***C*** [Catalog]
- ***B*** [Base table]
- ***CRSE*** [Course information]
